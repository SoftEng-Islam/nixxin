      # eza is a modern replacement for ls. It uses colours for information by default,
      # helping you distinguish between many types of files,
      # such as whether you are the owner, or in the owning group.
      # It also has extra features not present in the original ls,
      # such as viewing the Git status for a directory,
      # or recursing into directories with a tree view.
      # eza is written in Rust, so itâ€™s small, fast, and portable.
