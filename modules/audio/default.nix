    #? What is ALSA?
    # ALSA stands for Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.
    # The Core Sound System in Linux
    # At its core, ALSA is the low-level audio driver framework built into the Linux kernel.
    # It:
    #- Talks directly to your sound hardware (sound cards, audio codecs, DACs, etc.)
    #- Provides kernel drivers for nearly all audio chips (Intel, Realtek, etc.)
    #- Offers user-space tools to configure audio (e.g., alsamixer, aplay)
